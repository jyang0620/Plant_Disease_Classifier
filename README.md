# Plant Disease Classifier

This repository contains the code predicting Plant Disease with Convolutional Neural Networks. We used the data from [PlantDoc](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset), a dataset of 2,598 images of plants in the wild with 13 different species and 17 different classes of diseases. Using complex CNN architecture of [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), we raised the accuracy used in the PlantDoc paper by around 25 percentage points.
